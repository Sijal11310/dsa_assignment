# INTRODUCTION

This program implements a **doubly linked list** and has **insertion and deletion operations** on it.  
Doubly linked list can traversal in forward and backward direction because each node contains
a pointer to the previous and the next node.

---

# DATA STRUCTURE USED

A **doubly linked list** is used to store data.  
To achieve that a structure is used.

The structure contains three elements:
- An integer variable `data` to store the value
- A structure pointer `next` to store the address of the next node
- A structure pointer `prev` to store the address of the previous node

This allows traversal in both direction in the list.

# FUNCTION USED

## void insert_after(struct linkedlist *s, int target, int val)

This function is used to insert a new node **after a given node**.

It takes three arguments:
- Address of the head node
- The value of the target node after which insertion is to be done
- The value to be inserted in the node which will be inserted to the list

### Working:
- The function traverses the list until it finds the node whose data matches the target value
- If the target node is not found,  error message is printed and fucntion returns
- If the target is found a new node is created using dynamic memory allocation
- The new node’s `next` pointer is linked to the target next node
- The new node’s `prev` pointer is linked to the target node
- The target node’s `next` pointer is updated to point to the new node

---

## void delete_node(struct linkedlist *s, int val)

This function deletes a node containing target value given by the user.

It takes two arguments:
- Address of the head node
- The value of the node to be deleted

### Working:
- The function traverses the list to locate the node with the given value
- If the node is not found, error message is printed and program returns
- If target node is found the `next` pointer of the previous node and the `prev` pointer of the next node is updated
- The memory occupied by the node is freed 

---

## void display(struct linkedlist *s)
This function displays all element in the list in forward direction.

### Working:
- Starting from the head node which is passed to the function each node’s data is printed
- Traversal continues until the node's next is NULL

---

# MAIN FUNCTION

The `main()` function performs the following steps to achieve the desired output:

- Allocating memory for the head node
- Initialize the head node of the doubly linked list
- Insert new nodes after given nodes using `insert_after()`
- Displays the list after insertion
- Delete a specified node using `delete_node()`
- Displays the list after deletion

---

# OUTPUT

After insertion:
10  20  30

After deletion:
10  30
