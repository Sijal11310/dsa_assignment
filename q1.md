INTRODUCTION

This program determines whether the parantheses in an expression are balanced or not.

WORKING

It uses a stack data structure to determine whether a paranthesis expression is matching or not.

When the opening bracket '(', '{', or '[' is found in the expression, it is pushed in the stack.
When a closing parenthesis ‘)’, ‘}’, or ‘]’ is found in the expresiion the program pops the top element from the stack and compares it with the closing parenthesis.

If a closing parenthesis is encountered when the stack is already empty or when the type of parentheses don’t match, then the expression is not balanced and there is a parentheses error.
If the expression is unbalanced, the program will print the expression is not balanced and will terminate the program right away.* After scanning the expression, you can click If the stack is empty, the braces are balanced, and if the stack is not empty, the expression is not balanced.

CODE EXPLANATION

A structure named stack is created that stores an integer variable to locate top and array of character
to store the expression (size = 50).

Function push()

It takes one argument i.e the stack pointer where you want to push and it checks first whether the stack is
even empty or not. If not then it prints stack overflow and returns.
If empty then increase the value of top by 1 and stores the actual opening parenthesis '(', '{', or '[' for later to match parenthesis.

In the code the stack pointer is stored as 's'.

Function pop()

It takes one argument i.e the stack pointer where you want to pop and it checks first whether the stack is
already empty. If empty then it prints expression is not balanced and exits the program.
If not empty then it checks whether the type of last opening parenthesis matches the current closing parenthesis.
If it matches then decrease the value of top by 1. If it doesn't match then it prints expression is not balanced and exits the program.

In the code the stack pointer is stored as 's'.

main()

A stack structure pointer 'q' is created using dynamic memory allocation and the top of the structure is
initialized at -1.
A char f of size 50 is declared to take expression as input for parenthesis matching, via help of scanf
the input is taken.

While loop is used for traversal till the end of char f i.e till '\0' appears.
If it encounters '(', '{', or '[' in the expression it pushes it in the stack q and
if it encounters ')', '}', or ']' in the expression it pops it out from the stack q and checks for matching type.

At last the top is checked:

If empty then the parenthesis is balanced in the expression.
If not then parenthesis are not matching in the expression.
Now, free the used space q and exit the code.

SAMPLE OUTPUT

⇒a + (b − c) ∗ (d
the parenthesis is not balanced in this expression

⇒m + [a − b ∗ (c + d ∗ {m)]
the parenthesis is not balanced in this expression

⇒a + (b − c)
the parenthesis is balanced in this expression
