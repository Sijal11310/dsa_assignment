# <p align="center">INTRODUCTION</p>

This is a program which implements linked list and it's traversal by reverse way.

## <p align="center">DATA STRUCTURE USED</p>

A linked list is used to store data, it is implemented via structure.  
The structure contains two elements , an integer named data to store data and  
a structure pointer that will be used to store the next address of the structure element.

## <p align="center">FUNCTION USED</p>

### void add(struct linkedlist *s,int val)

Here we will add an element at the last of the list it takes two arguments, the value we want  
to store and the address of the head note(1st node).  
Then it travels till the end of the list, it identifies it is the end of the list by seeing it's  
last element next which we keep at NULL and the while loop checks for that condition specifically

then we create a new node, assign it the value we want to store , make its next element NULL  
the previous node's next will also be pointed to the node we created.

---

### void insert_front_empty(struct linkedlist *s,int val)

Here we will add an element at the front of the list to intialize the list when the list is empty.

---

### void display_reverse(struct linkedlist *s)

The function here displays the elements of the linked list in reverse order. It uses a method called  
recursion to achieve that.

Working:  
If the current node is NULL then return.  
The function recursively calls itself with the next node.  
While returning from recursion, the data of each node is printed.  
This results in the list being displayed from last node to first node.

---

## <p align="center">MAIN FUNCTION</p>

The main() function performs the following process in order to achive the output:

Allocate memory for the head node.  
Initialize the list using insert_front_empty().  
Add additional nodes using add().  
Display the linked list in reverse order using the function display_reverse().
