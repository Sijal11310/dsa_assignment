INTRODUCTION

This is a computer program which will take the infix expression as input and produce its postfix form using the stack data structure and then evaluate the postfix form. The project aims to provide better understanding of data structures and its applications.


DATA STRUCTURE USED

A stack can be defined using a structure with the following components:
top → index of the top element
e[50] --> array holding characters (operators and operands)

FUNCTIONS USED

push(struct stack *s, char a)
Puts the element on the stack after testing for stack overflow.

pop(struct stack *s)
Pops and removes the top element from the stack and finally returns '\0' if the stack is empty.

precedence(char e)
Returns the precedence of operators:

^ → highest
*, / → medium
+, - → lowest

bool isOperator(char c) 
Determines whether a character is an operator(^, *, /, +, or -).

infix to postfix conversion

Algorithm

Scan the infix expression from the left.
If the character is an operand, add it immediately to the postfix expression.
If the character is an opening parenthesis (, push the character onto the stack.
If the character represents the closing parenthesis ‘)’, pop operators from the stack and add them to the postfix notation until the token ‘(‘ is encountered.


If the character is an operator:
Check the precedence of the operator if higher than the operator at top of stack push in the stack and if not
pop the operators till a operator with precedence less than appears or no operator appears and then push it in the stack

After the expression is scanned, pop the rest of the operators out of the stack, adding each to postfix.

POSTFIX EVALUATION

Algorithm
Scan the postfix expression from left to right.
If the character represents an operand, add the character to the stack.

If it is an operator:
Pop the first value -> op2 
Pop second value → op1

note pop(q)-'0' is done cause we need it to convert it into integer from char 
pop(q) let its asci code be 50 and 0  has asci code 48 so our integer is 2

Operation:
op1 operator op2

Push the result back onto the stack
Once the scan is finished, the final value left on the stack will be the value of the expression.

EXPONENT (^) OPERATION HANDLING
The symbol ^ represents power, whereas in C it is a bitwise XOR operator.

so the operation of exponentiation is performed by hand as follows:
op1 is considered the baseline op2 is treated as the exponent The result is calculated by multiplying op1, op2 Times NOTE.

finally our answer is in the stack but in string form 
we pop it out do a conversion from string to integer as done before and our answer is ready.

SAMPLE OUTPUT

2+5-9*2/5^6-2-5

Postfix expression 25+92*56^/-2-5- 
the answer of the expression is -2
